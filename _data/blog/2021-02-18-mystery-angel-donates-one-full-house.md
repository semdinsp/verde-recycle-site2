## MYSTERIOUS ANGEL FUNDS 1 FULL HOUSE

Verde is pleased to announce that the "mysterious angel" has completely funded one house $6000. On behalf of the recipient families we would like to send a big thank you to our anonymous donor. 

Verde is now finalizing the order for the recycled bricks from Caltech Timor (www.caltechtimor.com) and is in final discussions with the Nazareth foundation for the construction of the house. We would welcome the supply of other locally recycled building materials and please contact us if you have this available for purchase. 

Verde can not do the program on its own and thanks all the donors, partners and team members who have contributed to the project. All of us working together we can make a contribution to reduce and recycle plastic waste in Timor Leste.

 Stay safe and lets recycle.
