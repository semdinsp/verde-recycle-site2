Team, fantastic news!



An anonymous donor has kindly agreed to completely fund our first Verde Recycle house. For privacy reasons the donor wants to remain anonymous. Verdeka will manage the construction of the house.This is fantastic news as we can test out the production of building materials from recycled plastic and place orders on local suppliers. Total funding up to date is $6,000 for one house, $750 direct in Timor and a futrher $700 from gofundme collections.We will select one of our proposed families and start the build out process in February.We will keep you updated and thank you for your support. Please inform your friends of good news.

Today, Verdeka team met Nazareth Foundation team (FB: Nazareth Foundation) who is going to help us to build the first house to discuss the final construction cost. We will share the breakdown of the cost as soon as we received the revised final quote. The house construction will take an estimated 3 months to complete. We will buy the the recycled indoor pavers from Caltech ([www.caltech.com](http://www.caltech.com)) and recycled bricks from Mesak Training Centre. We will commence the construction estimated mid of February 2021. We will arrange a ground breaking ceremony prior the commencement of the construction.
