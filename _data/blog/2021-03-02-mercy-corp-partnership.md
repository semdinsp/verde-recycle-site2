## **VERDE AND MERCY CORPS JOIN FORCES TO IMPROVE PLASTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT IN TIMOR-LESTE**

Dili, 1 March 2021

Verde and Mercy Corps are pleased to announce their collaboration for the launch of a new plastic waste collection service in Dili, Timor-Leste.

Through Mercy Corps’ circular economy programming, the initiative will contribute to create a value chain for used plastic, which will support the goals of the Plastic Solutions Alliance – a combined effort between Caltech Ltd., the European Union, Heineken Timor-Leste, the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), Mercy Corps, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) that utilizes market-based solutions toadvance Timor-Leste toward ‘plastic neutral’ status.

The plastic collected by Verde will be recycled into locally sought-after products and construction materials. Verde is excited to work with the Plastic Solutions Alliance to grow a competitive plastic recycling industry that will create valuable economic opportunities, while protecting the natural beauty of Timor-Leste and the health and safety of its people.

Stay Safe and Let’s Recycle
