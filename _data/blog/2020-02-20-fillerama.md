## Tile production

We have successfully produced tiles from plastic bottles.  We have also created dyed tiles suitable for indoor/outdoor usage.  We are testing endurance of the tiles and have created samples.

You've swallowed a planet! Noâ€¦ It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! **Kill me!** *KILL ME!* Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

## Next Steps

We need to adjust the thickness of our production process to create different tiles for different usage scenarios. 

## Costs

Our production cost structure currently needs scaling up to reduce per item costs.  However our business model shows we can achieve cost competitive tiles with commerical products.
