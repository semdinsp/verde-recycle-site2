## Tile production

We have successfully produced tiles from plastic bottles.  We have also created dyed tiles suitable for indoor/outdoor usage.  We are testing endurance of the tiles and have created samples.

## Next Steps

We need to adjust the thickness of our production process to create different tiles for different usage scenarios. 

## Costs

Our producer's cost structure currently needs scaling up to reduce per item costs.  However our business model shows we can achieve cost competitive tiles with commerical products.
