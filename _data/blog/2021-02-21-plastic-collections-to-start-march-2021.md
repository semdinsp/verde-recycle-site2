## Collections to Start in March

We are pleased to announce that collections of plastic from the MercyCorp sponsored bins will start in March.  Please [contact us](/contact) via the form on the website if you want to participate as well.  We aim to collect every five days (or roughly 6 times per month).

You can see the bins on the [linked map](https://recycle-qrcode.herokuapp.com/bins/googlemaps).

We like to thank MercyCorp, Caltech and others for their support and any mistakes will be our own fault.  :)
