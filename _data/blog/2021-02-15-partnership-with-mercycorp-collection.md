VERDE is pleased to announce the formation of partnership with Mercy Corps ([www.mercycorps.com](http://www.mercycorps.com)) for recycled plastic collection. Mercy Corps will subsidize 50 recycle bins around Dili, Timor Leste whereas Verde will do the recycle plastic collection weekly. The material plastic collected would be PTE and HDPE

VERDE will distribute the collected plastics to Caltech ([www.caltechtimor.com](http://www.caltechtimor.com)) and other non profit hand-crafted plastic recycler to be re-produced to final product of recycled plastic such as pavers and bricks. The recycle pavers and bricks which would be used for the Verde Recycled House (<https://www.gofundme.com/f/verde-recycled-house>)

This will create eco-system cycle of recycle to sustain its productivity. We need to work hand in hand to support the recycle program. VERDE would not be able to conduct the program with its own. Thank you to all of our partners across to support the recycle program happened. Together we can help to save environment in Timor Leste from plastic wastes!



Stay Safe and Recycle!
